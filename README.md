**Project Summary**
The purpose of this project is to collect data from public, Georgia goverment webistes, and present the data in a more useful and helpful manner as an API, with the eventual goal of providing input for end-user apps that can easily let non-technical people have clear access to the publicly reported funding sources for Georgia politicians.  This project is what you might call "Phase I" of a longer vision.  Here we are just obtaining and exposing data via a web-api (RESTful interface), that client apps will be able to use.  Once done, this will open several opportunities for using the data, such as mobile apps, reports & data analysis, but all of those are outside the scope of this project.  This project is strictly about obtaining and exposing the data via a web-api, and any steps along the way to achieving that goal.

**Disclaimer**
This project will be obtaining data from publicly available data sources, in a manner that is consistent with state and federal law.
