# New Georgia-Political Finance API Project

**Sponsor:** [New Georgia Project](https://newgeorgiaproject.org/)

**Affiliation:** [Code for Atlanta](https://www.codeforatlanta.org/)
 
### Summary
The purpose of this project is to collect data from public, Georgia goverment webistes, and present the data in a more useful and helpful manner as an API, with eventual goal of providing input for end-user apps that can easily let non-technical people have clear access to the publicly reported funding sources for Georgia politicians.
