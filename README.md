# New Georgia-Election Money - API Project

## Project Overview

Objective: Provide a web-api that exposes public data on Georgia political candidates and their funding sources.

Sponsor: [New Georgia Project](https://newgeorgiaproject.org/)

Affiliation: [Code for Atlanta](https://www.codeforatlanta.org/)

Project status: Research & planning

**Project Summary**
The purpose of this project is to collect data from public, Georgia goverment webistes, and present the data in a more useful and helpful manner as an API, with the eventual goal of providing input for end-user apps that can easily let non-technical people have clear access to the publicly reported funding sources for Georgia politicians.  This project is what you might call "Phase I" of a longer vision.  Here we are just obtaining and exposing data via a web-api (RESTful interface), that client apps will be able to use.  Once done, this will open several opportunities for using the data, such as mobile apps, reports & data analysis, but all of those are outside the scope of this project.  This project is strictly about obtaining and exposing the data via a web-api, and any steps along the way to achieving that goal.

**Needed Skills**
- Web scraping
- Database
- Web API (REST)
- Data analysis
- Subject matter expect on Georgia government offices
- Security

This project will be obtaining data from publicly available data sources, in a manner that is consistent with state and federal law.

Note to participants: If you'd like to recommend a special tool or technology, please read over the project description first to get a good understanding of what we're trying to do, then write up a summary page with the following info and post it on our Slack channel:
1. Description of the tool/technology.  And it's cost (Very important, since we're currently a $0 budget project).
1. Explain pros & cons of using it.
1. Explain which problem in this project it would solve.  Note: If you expand the scope of the project to answer this question, you're cheating. :)
